<h3>The culture shift</h3>
		<p>The school was founded on the values of tinkering and experimenting. Teachers were not supposed to lecture; instead, all lessons were to be hands-on. Additionally, there were no AP or IB classes, so that students could focus on the enjoyment of learning, cooperation, and real-life problem-solving. As more academies were added, the school turned away from experimental education and towards a traditional high school curriculum, focused on college-prep, becoming certified to teach the IB diploma in 2004 and gradually gathering a repertoire of AP classes. Now, students are more concerned with grades and “course rigor” (aka taking as many AP classes as possible) than actually learning. This has caused a mental health crisis.</p>
		<p>Competition and pressure to “succeed” (aka go to an Ivy and get a high paying job) are causing many students high rates of anxiety and depression. We hope that through this disorientation guide, as well as SAU’s mental health initiative, we can begin to change this culture.</p>
		<h3>History of academies</h3>
		<p>The Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology was founded in 1992 by Dr. John Grieco. In 1997 and 1998, the academies for Business and Computer Technology (ABCT), Engineering and Design Technology (AEDT), and Medical Science Technology (AMST), Culinary Arts (ACA), Power and Transportation (APT), and Visual Arts and Graphic Communications (AVAGC) were opened. In 2002, APT was abolished, ABCT was split into Academy for Business and Finance (ABF) and the Academy for Telecommunications and Computer Science (ATCS). In 2012, ATCS was renamed from telecommunications to technology, ACA expanded to include hospitality administration, and AVAGC expanded to include performing arts, becoming the Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA).</p>
