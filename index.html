<h3>About the guide</h3>
<p>Official orientation does not tell you all that you need to know, so we made this: The Disorientation Guide. While official orientation might educate you on all the opportunities of our school, it doesn’t tell you how to navigate them. Here you’ll find letters written by juniors and seniors with advice for underclassmen. Furthermore, there are health resources, covering topics inadequately covered in health classes. Additionally, we’ve compiled a list of resources for homework help, finding books and research papers, guidance department help, and more. Lastly, you’ll find a brief history of BCA.</p>
