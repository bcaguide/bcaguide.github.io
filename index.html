		<h1>Disorientation Guide</h1>
	</div>
		<h3>About the guide</h3>
		<p>Official orientation does not tell you all that you need to know, so we made this: The Disorientation Guide. While official orientation might educate you on all the opportunities of our school, it doesn’t tell you how to navigate them. Here you’ll find letters written by juniors and seniors with advice for underclassmen. Additionally, we’ve compiled a list of resources for homework help, finding books and research papers, guidance department help, and more. Lastly, you’ll find a brief history of BCA.</p>
		<p>If you are a junior or a senior and wish to write your own letter, the link to submit them is <a href="https://forms.gle/V2BEhHwXLqLZLLPL7">here</a>. The directions are at the top (please read!).</p>

		<h3>Where to find what you need</h3>
		<h5>Mental health</h5>
		<p>BCA has a wellness team (including a psychologist and a dietitian) that you can go to for therapy if you can't get it outside of school. Their contact info isn't on BCA's site (because of course it isn't), but you can ask either Ms. Sytsma or your guidance counselor to provide you with names/emails. If you're uncomfortable asking directly, it's a good idea to have a friend do it for you.</p>
		<h5>Gender-neutral bathroom + changing room locations</h5>
		<p><em>1st floor:</em> Go to the guidance hallway by the front office and across from commons are two gender neutral bathrooms. Use the one on the right, as the left one is locked for staff.</p>
		<p><em>1st floor:</em> Go to the engineering wing and across from Mr. Sam’s room (164), turn right into a smaller hallway with a teacher’s office/lounge and go to the bathroom on the right, as the left one is locked for staff.</p>
		<p><em>Basement:</em> Go to the basement. The gender neutral bathroom + locker room is adjacent to the girl’s locker room, which is between the fitness center and Ms. Pero’s room (6). The door closest to the stairs is the one you need to use. The other door leads straight into the girls’ locker room. Once you go through that first door, continue straight to the gray door, and use that one. The door to the left in that passageway goes to the girls’ locker room. The bathroom is inside the GN locker room.</p>

		<h3>The culture shift</h3>
		<p>The school was founded on the values of tinkering and experimenting. Teachers were not supposed to lecture; instead, all lessons were to be hands-on. Additionally, there were no AP or IB classes, so that students could focus on the enjoyment of learning, cooperation, and real-life problem-solving. As more academies were added, the school turned away from experimental education and towards a traditional high school curriculum, focused on college-prep, becoming certified to teach the IB diploma in 2004 and gradually gathering a repertoire of AP classes. Now, students are more concerned with grades and “course rigor” (aka taking as many AP classes as possible) than actually learning. This has caused a mental health crisis.</p>
		<p>Competition and pressure to “succeed” (aka go to an Ivy and get a high paying job) are causing many students high rates of anxiety and depression. We hope that through this disorientation guide, as well as SAU’s mental health initiative, we can begin to change this culture.</p>
		<h3>History of academies</h3>
		<p>The Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology was founded in 1992 by Dr. John Grieco. In 1997 and 1998, the academies for Business and Computer Technology (ABCT), Engineering and Design Technology (AEDT), and Medical Science Technology (AMST), Culinary Arts (ACA), Power and Transportation (APT), and Visual Arts and Graphic Communications (AVAGC) were opened. In 2002, APT was abolished, ABCT was split into Academy for Business and Finance (ABF) and the Academy for Telecommunications and Computer Science (ATCS). In 2012, ATCS was renamed from telecommunications to technology, ACA expanded to include hospitality administration, and AVAGC expanded to include performing arts, becoming the Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA).</p>
