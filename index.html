<h3>About the guide</h3>
<p>Our official orientation does not tell you all that you need to know. While the school might educate you on all the opportunities they have to offer, students can tell you how to navigate them. That’s why we made the Disorientation Guide.</p>
<p>Here you’ll find letters written by juniors and seniors with advice for underclassmen. Furthermore, there are health resources, covering topics inadequately covered in health classes. Additionally, we’ve compiled a list of resources for homework help, finding books and research papers, guidance department help, and more. Lastly, you’ll find a brief history of BCA culture and academies.</p>
