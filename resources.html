<h3>Where to find what you need</h3>
<h5>Mental health</h5>
<p>BCA has a wellness team (including a psychologist and a dietitian) that you can go to for therapy if you can't get it outside of school. Their contact info isn't on BCA's site (because of course it isn't), but you can ask either Ms. Sytsma or your guidance counselor to provide you with names/emails. If you're uncomfortable asking directly, it's a good idea to have a friend do it for you.</p>
<h5>Gender-neutral bathroom + changing room locations</h5>
<p><em>1st floor:</em> Go to the guidance hallway by the front office and across from commons are two gender neutral bathrooms. Use the one on the right, as the left one is locked for staff.</p>
<p><em>1st floor:</em> Go to the engineering wing and across from Mr. Sam’s room (164), turn right into a smaller hallway with a teacher’s office/lounge and go to the bathroom on the right, as the left one is locked for staff.</p>
<p><em>Basement:</em> Go to the basement. The gender neutral bathroom + locker room is adjacent to the girl’s locker room, which is between the fitness center and Ms. Pero’s room (6). The door closest to the stairs is the one you need to use. The other door leads straight into the girls’ locker room. Once you go through that first door, continue straight to the gray door, and use that one. The door to the left in that passageway goes to the girls’ locker room. The bathroom is inside the GN locker room.</p>
